# Exercise 37:NamethatShape
#  (Solvedâ€”31 Lines)
#  Write a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read
#  the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of
#  a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3
#  up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered
#  then your program should display an appropriate error message
