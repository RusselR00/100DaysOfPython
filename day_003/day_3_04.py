#  Create a program that determines how quickly an object is traveling when it hits the
#  ground.Theuserwillentertheheightfromwhichtheobjectisdroppedinmeters(m).
#  Because the object is dropped its initial speed is 0m/s. Assume that the acceleration
#  due to gravity is 9.8m/s2. You can use the formula vf = v2
#  i + 2ad to compute the
