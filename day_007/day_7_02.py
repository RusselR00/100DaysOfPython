#  Exercise 42:FrequencyToNote
#  (Solvedâ€”40 Lines)
#  In the previous question you converted from note name to frequency. In this question
#  you will write a program that reverses that process. Begin by reading a frequency
#  from the user. If the frequency is within one Hertz of a value listed in the table in
#  the previous question then report the name of the note. Otherwise report that the
#  frequency does not correspond to a known note. In this exercise you only need to
#  consider the notes listed in the table. There is no need to consider notes from other
#  octaves
