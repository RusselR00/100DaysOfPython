# (Solvedâ€”40 Lines)

# The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the

# exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the

# waythatthecalendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:

# Season Firstday

# Spring March20

# Summer June21

# Fall September22

# Winter December21

# Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter

# the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an

# integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date that

# was entered
month = input("Enter the month: ")
day = int(input("Enter the day: "))
